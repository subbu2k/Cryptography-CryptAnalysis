# Cryptography-CryptAnalysis
Assignment as part of course Number Theory and Cryptography

The aim of this assignment is to get more familiar with SageMath tool used by Cyber Security Researchers in developing Cryptographic algorithms, its implementations and Cryptanalysis.

The following algorithms were implemented using SageMath tool and various attacks had been done as part of cryptanalysis
-> Affine cipher;
-> Hill cipher;
-> Shift cipher;
-> Substitution cipher;
-> Transposition cipher;
-> Vigenere cipher;
